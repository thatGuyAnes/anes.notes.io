# Notes pages

I use a combination of [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/) and
[vim-wiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) plugin to manage my notes.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
