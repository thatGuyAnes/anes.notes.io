### ATS:

Most companies out there relies on a ATS(Application Tracking System) to
process and parse incoming resumes, and most of the times the first interaction
will not be with a human but with a bot.

So if you get an automated response, chances are that your application has been
treated by an ATS.

That why, some recruiter demand a "primitive" resume format in word format,
sometime the ATS is not sophisticated enough to handle PDFs, heavy formatting,
colors, chars, images etc etc.

It's a good idea to have two versions of your resume: One that is styled,
flashy, uses colors and charts that you send to a proper person and a second **boring**
version targeted for generic applications that uses ATSs.

Why this is relative? Because ATS will rank the processed applicants' resumes,
and recruiter will only go for the couple highest ranked applications.

### Recruitment cycles:

Most of the companies have a recruitment cycle, typically it's at the beginning
of the year where they have a budget set for new positions.

Doing some research and knowing when these recruitment cycles occurs can boost
your chances at getting your application accepted.
