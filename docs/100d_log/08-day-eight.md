# Day 08: Nov 25 2021

### Day's Progress

Finally Installed vimwiki.
Created a note taking script:
Using a simple bash script and some i3 configuration, I managed to call
vim-diary on the fly with mod+n wherever I'm on the machine.

### Thoughts

Had and idea to expand this script so that it shows a prompt in the terminal,
to choose where the note will be saved i.e: personal, linux, project,etc.

I have to stop logging this challenge for now.
