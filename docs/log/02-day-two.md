# Day 02: Nov 15 2021

### Day's Progress

Not much coding for this session, worked on setting up my notes.

- Deployed my notes. _First I used netlify but then I wanted to try out GitHub pages_.
Now I have a live version that I can share with the world.

- Did some cleanup to my vim config.

### Thoughts

I can see myself seriously committing to this challenge, I need to manage my time to balance things out.
