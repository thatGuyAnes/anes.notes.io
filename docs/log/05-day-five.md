# Day 05: Nov 21 2021

### Day's Progress

working on my neovim's configuration.

- [X] find references.
- [X] go to definition.
- [X] hover.
- [X] rename.
- [X] format.
- [] completion.
- [] code actions.

Got sucked it, wasted time trying to figure out what's making code action
behaviour so buggy.

This require more time to make it work, I'm putting this on hold and back to
the old coc-nvim config.

### Thoughts

I need to find a way to better manage my cofigs, the amount of informations
required to understand each piece of the puzzle is daunting.
On the other hand, I can just copy/paste stuff and piece it together to come up
with a performing config, but that's asking for more problems to come along the
ride.

Neovim is soon to be releasing the next version, I'll give lsp a try then, but
for now even though coc-vim is slow, it works out the box, and I can do
  everything with it.
