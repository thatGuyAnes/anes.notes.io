### Day's Progress

Discovered [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) :heart_eyes: man this is so neat.

Made a basic doc website to host my logs.

Struggled a bit with setting up the sidebar (Always read documentation).

### Thoughts

 I think I can expand this to be like a companion notes thing.

The more exposure to React the better, as Docusaurus is build on React.
